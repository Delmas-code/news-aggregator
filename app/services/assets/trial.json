        "value": "<h3>Get ready for the first day of school with us!</h3>\n<p>The first day of school is right around the corner, and it\u2019s time to get excited! With a little preparation, you can turn first-day jitters into first-day joy. Here are 10 fun and practical ways to ensure your child\u2019s first day back is the best one yet, with a little help from <a href=\"https://go.learn.khanacademy.org/khanacademy/bts_other\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Khan Academy Kids</a>.</p>\n<h3>1. Organize school supplies</h3>\n<p>Who doesn\u2019t love new school supplies? Before the start of the school year, your child\u2019s school or district will often share supply lists that can help guide you in your shopping. Consider generating some excitement by taking your little one with you to collect their items!</p>\n<p>Practice the names of each item by saying them out loud together as you put them in the shopping cart. Buy early to avoid the last-minute rush, and add some colorful flair to your selections!</p>\n<p>No school-supply list? At a minimum, consider preparing for the first day of school by shopping for essential items like backpacks, notebooks, and pencils.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"crayons and school supplies\" class=\"aligncenter\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExN3RiMnI4OXExaDFrNGE5d2F5am1waWtyenVjZGoybGM0bjR1Y2l4YSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/1wmbRTd4EUJUkf2fzL/giphy.gif\" width=\"480\" /></p>\n<h3>2. Set up a homework zone</h3>\n<p>Just like you need a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JDEJ8AnHw_0?si=4MPLko-Mpm-sRqbW&amp;t=300\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">workspace</a>, creating a cozy study space for your child to do their homework can make a huge difference in their ability to focus. A tidy, well-organized space helps them stay motivated and get excited about learning.</p>\n<p>We recommend choosing the spot\u2014ideally a place that you can keep an eye on but also somewhere where your child can have some separation and quiet from the rest of the after-school hustle and bustle. Let your child personalize their area with fun decorations and comfy seating.</p>\n<p>If you have older children, consider what your younger children will do if they finish their homework before the others. The <a href=\"https://go.learn.khanacademy.org/khanacademy/bts_other\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Khan Academy Kids app</a> can be a fantastic addition to their study time, offering engaging and educational activities.</p>\n<h3>3. Establish a routine</h3>\n<p>Routines bring peace and predictability to the day. Start by setting up a morning and evening <a href=\"https://khankids.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041359272-Daily-Schedules-for-Ages-2-8\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">schedule</a>. For example:</p>\n<p>Morning: an energizing breakfast, a quick review of the day&#8217;s schedule, and a pep talk<br />\nEvening: homework, dinner, a bit of fun with <a href=\"https://go.learn.khanacademy.org/khanacademy/bts_other\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Khan Academy Kids</a>, and a relaxing bedtime routine</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-building-a-back-to-school-routine/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Experts recommend</a> practicing this routine at least a week before the school year starts. Consider having your little one wake up at the right time, go through the motions of getting ready, and eventually running through a similar nighttime routine so they\u2019ll know what to expect when school begins.</p>\n<h3>4. Review lessons from last year</h3>\n<p>Dust off those books and take a trip down memory lane with last year\u2019s materials. Or, if your child seems ready, get a head start on the new curriculum to help them feel more confident.</p>\n<p>Missing at-home materials? We\u2019ve got you covered! <a href=\"https://go.learn.khanacademy.org/khanacademy/bts_other\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Khan Academy Kids</a> is a great way to jumpstart learning for the new year. With thousands of lessons and activities in <a href=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org/khan-kids-kindergarten-math-games/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">math</a> and literacy, there\u2019s sure to be <a href=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org/khan-kids-free-books-for-kids/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">something for everyone</a>!</p>\n<h3>5. Plan healthy meals</h3>\n<p>Fueling up with nutritious meals is key to a successful school day. Plan balanced breakfasts and lunches that are both delicious and fun to eat. Here are some easy, healthy recipe ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Breakfast:</strong> colorful fruit smoothies, oatmeal with toppings, and avocado toast</li>\n<li><strong>Lunch:</strong> turkey and cheese wraps, vibrant fruit salads, and veggie sticks with hummus</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Want to be your child\u2019s teacher\u2019s best friend? Ensure your child knows how to independently open everything they pack to ensure a quick and pleasant lunchtime for everyone.</p>\n<p>Want to be your own best friend? Consider packing lunches the night before and creating a morning routine that teaches your child to be responsible for removing their own lunchbox from the refrigerator and adding it to their backpack on the way out the door in the morning. We promise, your sanity will thank you.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"healthy lunch\" class=\"size-large aligncenter\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExam5oYnZ0ZHptdWJlNzJvMTdhYnl4MGI4dW5tMjRrNm9jaW53eTFuaSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/TFTLx30jxieEYafdgi/giphy.gif\" width=\"480\" /></p>\n<h3>6. Address emotional well-being</h3>\n<p>First-day butterflies are normal! Talk about <a href=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org/khan-kids-emotion-wheel-help-kids-learn-about-feelings/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">feelings</a> and turn anxiety into excitement. Engage your child with calming and enjoyable activities available on Khan Academy Kids to help ease your kid\u2019s nerves.</p>\n<p>In fact, for a specific read-aloud that can generate some great family discussions, try our book <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRXWFeBtGg\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Starting School</a>. Together, you can discuss how the flamingo is feeling and relate that to your child\u2019s experiences. For more tips, check out our special section of social-emotional learning tools.</p>\n<h3>7. Set goals for the school year</h3>\n<p>Goal setting can be a fun and motivating activity! Help your child set both academic and personal goals. Use a <a href=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org/khan-kids-goal-setting-for-kids/\">downloadable goal-setting worksheet</a> to track their progress and celebrate achievements.</p>\n<h3>8. Plan first-day outfits</h3>\n<p>Help your child feel confident by choosing a first-day outfit together. Make it a fun activity by considering different weather options and letting them express their style. Even if your child\u2019s school requires a uniform, fun things like hair accessories or a unique jacket can inspire a bit of individuality and creativity while still paying attention to the rules.</p>\n<p>Consider laying out full outfits together with your child the night before. Knowing that they look great can give them an extra boost of confidence. Plus, having the items ready will make it more likely that they leave with matching socks and shoes, even if you haven\u2019t had your coffee yet.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"back to school outfits\" class=\"alignnone size-large\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExb2JhYWRjMmUzYXR6cmFndHQ4YW0yZmtsN2hteG9sZzFrY28yNXF3ciZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/YFFG2DXOIfNBWWvzwo/giphy.gif\" width=\"480\" /></p>\n<h3>9. Meet the teacher</h3>\n<p>Building a positive relationship with teachers is crucial. Send a friendly email introduction to get started. Here\u2019s a sample to help you out:</p>\n<p><em>Dear [Teacher&#8217;s Name],</em></p>\n<p><em>I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I am the parent of [Child&#8217;s Name], who will be joining your class this year. We are excited about the upcoming school year and look forward to collaborating with you to ensure [Child&#8217;s Name]&#8217;s success.</em></p>\n<p><em>Please let us know if there are specific things we can do to support you now and throughout the year. We\u2019d love to stay involved!</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you for your time and support.</em></p>\n<p><em>Best regards,</em><br />\n<em>[Your Name]</em></p>\n<h3>10. Prepare for transportation</h3>\n<p>Make transportation fun and stress free! Whether it\u2019s the bus, a carpool, or walking, plan the route and timing together.</p>\n<p>Assuming you\u2019re committed to a week of routine before the year begins, consider adding in this next part. Explain in detail how your child will get to school, and then mimic the journey together.</p>\n<p>If it\u2019s a carpool, ensure they know who is safe to join in a car and who is not. If it\u2019s the bus, help them understand what it\u2019ll be like to get on, select a seat, and sit politely while they wait to arrive at school. Emphasize safety and they\u2019re sure to enjoy the journey!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"carpool\" class=\"alignnone size-large\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://i.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbmY3ZDJjb2M1ZHBmZDFyYThoaHRmcDZvOXl2NXBkbnd3ZnllaG8yNSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/WNfwqzdbm35H9ENmzq/giphy.gif\" width=\"480\" /></p>\n<h3>Finally, remember to breathe</h3>\n<p>With all the excitement and preparation, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kiepEMrHfw\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">taking a moment to breathe</a> is important. Encourage your child (and yourself!) to take deep breaths, relax, and enjoy the journey. A calm and positive mindset can make all the difference on the first day of school.<br />\nWe can\u2019t wait to hear how it goes!</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll be ready to rock the first day of school by following these tips.</p>\n<p>As you prepare for a smooth and joyful transition into the new school year, remember that Khan Academy Kids would love to be a part of it.

Khan Academy is thrilled to announce two new mechanics designed to make learning a bit more fun and motivating: streaks and levels!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Streaks are designed to promote and celebrate consistency, motivating learners to get at least one skill to proficient or higher each week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Levels are designed to break apart the daunting task of completing an entire course into smaller, more manageable milestones. At the end of each level, users can celebrate with a \u201clevel up\u201d that recognizes their progress towards their goals!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theory behind both of these mechanics is simple yet powerful: regular, consistent practice fosters learning and retention, and \u201cchunking\u201d divides larger, potentially overwhelming goals into smaller, more achievable tasks. When learners combine regular practice with smaller tasks,&nbsp; Khan Academy can be more encouraging and rewarding than ever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-streaks\">Why streaks?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Motivation isn&#8217;t a fixed trait that students either possess or lack; it can grow or shrink depending on one\u2019s environment and strategies. We wanted our new streaks to embody this philosophy and help users create healthy learning habits that align with learning science in a fun and engaging way.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17234\" height=\"230\" src=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Step-2.gif\" width=\"424\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>That being said, we didn\u2019t just want <em>any</em> old streak, we wanted each added week to display meaningful learning. We could have had users renew a streak by watching a video or attempting an exercise. But given the importance of practice and our mastery system, we believe getting one skill to proficient or higher is the ideal indicator that users are on the right track to progressing toward their goals (and <a href=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org/why-khan-academy-will-be-using-skills-to-proficient-to-measure-learning-outcomes/\">we have efficacy research studies to back that claim</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want users to be able to look back on their streak at the end of a school year with a deep sense of pride and accomplishment for their hard work and consistency!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-levels\">Why levels?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We can imagine that for some of you, the addition of levels may seem a bit unnecessary. After all, some learners are already racking up hundreds of hours of learning and practicing hundreds of skills per year on Khan Academy, so why make changes to the user experience to \u201cgamify\u201d learning?</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17299\" height=\"230\" src=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/step-1-1.gif\" width=\"424\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Although some users <em>are</em> <em>already</em> highly motivated to learn on their own, the reality is that <em>many more users</em> would love a way to view and celebrate their progress in a way that helps get the wheels of motivation moving. We believe levels and streaks are a great way for everyone to celebrate their journey on Khan Academy, and these features could be the motivation for many students to make Khan Academy a part of their weekly routine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-can-i-start\">How can I start?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To begin, simply visit your current favorite Khan Academy exercise and start leveling up skills! Or, visit our support article to <a href=\"https://support.khanacademy.org/hc/articles/360054115071\">find out more about streaks and how leveling up works.</a></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17237\" height=\"230\" src=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/step-3.gif\" width=\"424\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Hope these features are an exciting addition to your Khan Academy experience, and we will continue to refine and improve them in the coming weeks and months. Stay tuned!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org/get-motivated-to-learn-with-khan-academys-new-streaks-and-levels-features/\">Get Motivated to Learn with Khan Academy\u2019s New Streaks and Levels Features</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org\">Khan Academy Blog</a>.</p>"

Science is often framed as the opposite of creative: a meticulous, data-driven activity that\u2019s logical, rational, and detail-oriented. This leaves many students feeling disengaged and unable to connect with science\u2014or get excited about it as a field of future study.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, creative thinking was the catalyst for some of history\u2019s most important scientific breakthroughs, from Copernican astronomy to quantum physics to the discovery of the structure of DNA. If we are to successfully tackle the problems and challenges of the future, creativity in science is essential. That\u2019s why Khan Academy has partnered with Adobe to create <a href=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org/free-science-activities-teachers/\">free, downloadable science activities</a> with real-world applications\u2014activities that teachers can effortlessly incorporate into their lesson plans to get kids engaged with science.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-13 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\">Download free science activities</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color\" id=\"h-what-do-we-mean-when-we-say-creativity\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>What do we mean when we say creativity?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Creativity is simply the act of discovering new and imaginative ideas, making connections between seemingly unrelated things, and finding solutions to problems. Each time a student figures out a way to solve a problem that had not occurred to them before or imagines new possibilities for the future, they are using their creativity.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17022\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Frame-2-512x512.png\" width=\"512\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color\" id=\"h-how-can-we-foster-creativity-in-the-classroom\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong><strong>How can we foster creativity in the classroom?</strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Inspire curiosity.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sparking kids\u2019 curiosity is where creativity in science starts. You can help your students by encouraging them to ask questions, dig deeper into topics that interest them, and experiment wherever possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give kids an opportunity for hands-on learning that lets them put their ideas to the test in the real world, download this free science activity created by Khan Academy and Adobe: <strong><a href=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org/free-science-activities-teachers/\">How does water form droplets on surfaces?\u00a0</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Promote a growth mindset.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Encouraging a growth mindset in the classroom can counteract damaging ideas about who gets to be creative. By emphasizing perseverance and resilience and embracing failure as part of the learning process, you can help your students exercise their creative muscles. Instead of seeing mistakes as something to feel bad about, celebrate them as valuable learning experiences. What would you do differently next time?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Emphasize collaboration.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The isolated genius who hides in a lab and emerges years later with a world-shaking idea is more a myth than a reality. Research has shown that breakthrough innovation is more likely to be achieved through teamwork. That\u2019s because when people with different specialties, perspectives, and life experiences come together, team members are better able to see the connections between concepts they might have missed when working alone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By assigning group projects, you can help your students develop the skills they need for successful collaboration. They will learn how to brainstorm, share ideas, and use each person\u2019s strengths to get the work done. As a bonus, exposure to many different perspectives can teach kids to examine their own ideas critically and to consider alternate points of view.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Allow time and space.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creativity doesn\u2019t flow on demand. It needs time and space to flourish. You can encourage your students by giving them the freedom to explore their passions and conduct independent research as much as the curriculum and classroom demands allow. Supply resource materials like books and allow them to use available laboratory equipment. Then have them present their findings to the class. This gives students a sense of autonomy and control that allows creativity to grow and develop.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Free, downloadable science activities from Khan Academy and Adobe<strong> </strong>not only teach kids basic concepts, but they also provide lots of suggestions for how to use their creativity to generate new ideas and solutions. Activities like <strong><a href=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org/free-science-activities-teachers/\">Why do clothes develop static cling in a dryer?</a> </strong>are engaging, comprehensive, and ready to use right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color\" id=\"h-save-hours-of-searching-with-our-free-hands-on-activities\" style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong><strong>Save HOURS of searching with our FREE hands-on activities</strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With all that goes on in a busy classroom in the course of a day, building lessons and projects that help students tap into their creativity might seem like an overwhelming task. But don\u2019t worry. Khan Academy and Adobe have created <a href=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org/free-science-activities-teachers/\">high-quality science activities</a> to support your work in the classroom. They\u2019re rigorous, comprehensive, and designed to get your students engaged. Plus, they\u2019re already planned and fit easily into your curriculum. So you can focus your energy on helping your students build the skills that will help them become practiced creative thinkers today and innovators and problem solvers tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-14 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org/free-science-activities-teachers/\">Save time with our free activities</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org/creativity-is-the-future-of-science-how-to-get-kids-thinking-creatively/\">Creativity is the Future of Science: How to Get Kids Thinking Creatively</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://blog.khanacademy.org\">Khan Academy Blog</a>.</p>"
