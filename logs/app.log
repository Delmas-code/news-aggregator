They’re about to incorporate user-generated advertisements in their system. This new development comes as quite a surprise, given the company’s previous statements against the use of ads for revenue generation. However, it appears that the winds have shifted, and now, Discord is ready to explore the financial potential of\xa0ads.Historically, Discord has always been vocal about its anti-advertising stance. The company’s business model relied heavily on its “Nitro” subscriptions, which offered users enhanced functionality for a monthly fee ranging from $2.99 to $9.99. The decision to open up to advertisements marks a significant shift in their revenue generation approach.According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, Discord is planning to feature ads from video game developers and publishers in the coming week. The concept is that users will earn rewards for playing games and accomplishing “Sponsored Quests,” which are specific in-game tasks, while they stream for their friends to watch. The friends viewing the stream will then get their chances to complete a sponsored quest and earn their\xa0rewards.This approach bears a striking resemblance to the digital rewards or drops offered by Twitch, another popular streaming service, to viewers who watch certain streams as a part of paid partnerships.In January, Discord laid off 17% of its workforce, amounting to around 170 employees. This drastic decision, as stated by CEO Jason Citron, was a result of the need to “sharpen our focus” and “bring more agility to our organization.” This organizational shakeup seems to have paved the way for the introduction of ads on\xa0Discord.The integration of ads into Discord’s platform raises several questions. Will this move work in the company’s favor? How will users respond to the inclusion of ads in the otherwise seamless communication platform?Many users prefer Discord for its simple and unobtrusive communication capabilities. The introduction of ads could potentially dilute this experience, regardless of the digital goodies offered alongside them.Moreover, Discord’s plan to monetize user interactions might not sit well with some users. The idea of having their friendships monetized by the platform might lead to user dissatisfaction.It remains to be seen how this new development will pan out for Discord. It’s a risky move that could either bear fruit or backfire, depending on how the users\xa0react.It’s indeed a wait-and-watch situation for all stakeholders involved.In conclusion, the decision by Discord to incorporate user-generated ads represents a significant shift in their business model. While the idea of earning rewards for completing “Sponsored Quests” might sound appealing to some, others might see it as an intrusion into their gaming experience. Only time will tell whether this bold move will pay off for Discord, or if it will lead to user dissatisfaction and subsequently, a decline in their user\xa0base.', 'image_url': 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*faAaE7r0EARbL4v_'}

This upcoming open-world crime simulator has millions of gamers on the edge of their seats, eagerly waiting for any shred of news, screenshots, or updates. However, recent reports suggest that the game’s development has encountered some speed bumps, raising concerns about the originally slated release date for\xa02025.GTA 6 was officially announced in December 2023, almost a decade after the release of its predecessor, GTA V, which has garnered massive sales numbers and continues to grow in popularity. The announcement of the sequel set the gaming world ablaze with excitement and anticipation. Set in Vice City, a fictional take on Miami, Florida, GTA 6 is expected to be launched for PS5 and Xbox Series sometime in 2025, or at least that was the original\xa0plan.However, as per reports from anonymous sources, the development of GTA 6 has started experiencing delays, causing alarm among the leadership at Rockstar Games. The initial release window of 2025 might not be met, and the game could potentially slip into 2026. This unnerving possibility has led to Rockstar Games making a drastic decision of mandating its employees to return to work in-office from April\xa02024.This return-to-office mandate, as reported by Bloomberg in February, was a sudden and radical change that caught many employees off guard. It has led to a wave of dissatisfaction among staff members who were hired remotely and now feel pushed out. The decision was primarily driven by concerns about security and quality, but it seems that the predicament of GTA 6’s development falling behind schedule also played a significant part in this decision.Despite these measures, uncertainties persist around the game’s release timeline. While the internal target is still set for spring 2025, insiders suggest that a more realistic timeline would see the game launching in fall 2025. The reluctance of Rockstar to provide a specific release window beyond “2025” further underscores the uncertainty surrounding GTA 6’s development.Recent speculations align with a fan theory suggesting that GTA 6’s development may wrap up by early 2025. This theory is based on job listings indicating the completion of localization work in Q1 of that year. However, considering the history of the franchise, which is notorious for delays, the possibility of GTA 6 slipping into 2026 remains plausible.Should such a delay occur, it could also impact the release of the PC port, potentially pushing its availability to 2027 or later. This scenario mirrors the experience with GTA 5, which faced significant delays for its PC version, ultimately lagging behind its console counterparts.As fans eagerly await further updates, the uncertainty surrounding GTA 6’s development serves as a reminder of the challenges inherent in bringing such ambitious projects to fruition within set timelines. Nevertheless, the gaming community continues to be captivated by the mystery surrounding GTA 6’s development and\xa0release.The release of GTA 6 is undoubtedly one of the most highly anticipated events in the gaming world. While the potential delay might be disappointing for eager fans, it’s important to remember that creating a game of this magnitude is no small feat. As we wait for further updates from Rockstar Games, the gaming community can only hope that the final product will be worth the\xa0wait.Disclaimer: This article is a work of speculation based on available reports and fan theories. The actual timeline for the release of GTA 6 may differ from what is presented in this\xa0article.', 'image_url': 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*_BVux8StgfIceqZo'}

The Game Launcher, an app familiar to all Samsung phone users, has now been rebranded as the Gaming Hub. This move aims to unify Samsung’s gaming services across its different platforms.Samsung’s Game Launcher was an integral part of Samsung smartphones, providing a platform for users to access and manage their games. However, the recent rebranding has transformed the Game Launcher into the Gaming Hub. This change is more than just a new name; it integrates the Game Launcher’s features with Samsung’s other gaming services, especially those available on smart displays like smart TVs and projectors.Despite the rebranding, Samsung assures its users that the functionality and features of the Game Launcher will remain consistent in the Gaming Hub. The name change, however, aims to eliminate the confusion that arose from having two separate apps\u200a—\u200athe Game Launcher on smartphones and the Gaming Hub on smart displays\u200a—\u200awhen they essentially offered the same services.Samsung first launched the Gaming Hub in 2022, and it quickly gained popularity for its user-friendly interface and extensive features. One of the most notable features was the ability to connect a wireless controller to the display and utilize popular game streaming services. Samsung went a step further and introduced its own streaming service\u200a—\u200aInstant\xa0Plays.Instant Plays, a feature available on both the mobile Gaming Hub and on smart displays, allows users to start playing a game immediately without any need for downloading or installing it. Even though Instant Plays has been around since 2022, it remains in beta mode and is currently available only in the US and Canada. However, its promise of instant gaming has been a significant draw for users and contributes to the success of the Gaming\xa0Hub.Samsung’s rebranding efforts are not just about offering a seamless gaming experience to users. The company is also focused on providing support to game developers. Samsung’s cloud platform supports Android native APKs, provides a cloud-based attribution solution with major mobile measurement partner (MMP) providers, and even supports existing in-game monetization models. This initiative ensures that game publishers can easily integrate their operations with Samsung’s Gaming\xa0Hub.Some Samsung users noticed the rebranding of the Game Launcher to the Gaming Hub quite some time ago, while others are just now seeing the change. The response has been mixed, with some users expressing concern about the name change, but most seem to appreciate the unified approach to Samsung’s gaming services.The rebranding announcement also highlighted the Gaming Hub’s ability to stream games on mobile devices. The Instant Plays feature, which enables users to stream games without downloading them, is one of the primary reasons for the app’s growing popularity.While the rebranding of the Game Launcher to the Gaming Hub is an important step, many users and experts are looking forward to what Samsung will do next. One of the most anticipated features is the integration of cloud gaming services like Nvidia GeForce Now and Xbox Cloud Gaming into the mobile Gaming Hub. Currently, these services are only available on the Gaming Hub on Samsung TVs. If Samsung can bring these services to its mobile Gaming Hub, it would provide an all-in-one platform for accessing all cloud gaming services and their offerings, right from a Galaxy smartphone or\xa0tablet.In conclusion, Samsung’s move to rebrand the Game Launcher as the Gaming Hub is a strategic one that aims to eliminate confusion and provide a unified gaming experience across all its devices. By integrating features like Instant Plays and potentially adding other cloud gaming services, the Gaming Hub is set to become a one-stop solution for gaming enthusiasts using Samsung\xa0devices.', 'image_url': 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*JtUsVfMz4L64Vkdx'}

This move would facilitate landscape-mode FaceTime calls and other video conferencing applications, marking a significant change from the traditional portrait-mode design.The proposed change doesn’t come without its challenges. The central placement of the camera could interfere with the magnetic attachment for the Apple Pencil. Apple’s solution for this issue is eagerly awaited by tech enthusiasts worldwide.The relocated camera is speculated to carry the name “Landscape Ultra Wide camera” and is expected to retain the Center Stage support that iPad Air 5 offers.

This would cater to different user preferences, with the larger model offering a more immersive viewing experience.Earlier this year, CAD designs of what could be the 12.9-inch iPad Air were revealed.

You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!\xa0An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.\xa0Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.\xa0 Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.\xa0Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.\n\xa0Performance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising. Affiliate marketing is one form of performance marketing where commissions are paid out to affiliates on a performance basis when they click on their affiliate link and make a purchase or action.\xa0Smartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity.\xa0The best way to find affiliate publishers is on reputable networks like ShareASale Cj(Commission Junction), Awin, and Impact radius. These networks have a strict application process and compliance checks, which means that all affiliates are trustworthy.\xa0An affiliate disclosure statement discloses to the reader that there may be affiliate links on a website, for which a commission may be paid to the publisher if visitors follow these links and make purchases.\xa0Publishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic.\xa0A super affiliate is an affiliate partner who consistently drives a large majority of sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in that program.\xa0 Affiliates make a lot of money from affiliate marketing Pat Flynn earned more than $50000 in 2013 from affiliate marketing.\xa0Publishers can be identified by their publisher ID, which is used in tracking cookies to determine which publishers generate sales. The activity is then viewed within a network's dashboard.\xa0Because the Internet is so widespread, affiliate programs can be promoted in any country. Affiliate strategies that are set internationally need to be tailored to the language of the targeted country.Affiliate marketing can help you grow your business in the following ways:\xa0One of the best ways to work with qualified affiliates is to hire an affiliate marketing agency that works with all the networks. Affiliates are carefully selected and go through a rigorous application process to be included in the network.\xa0Affiliate marketing is generally associated with websites, but there are other ways to promote your affiliate links, including:\xa0To build your affiliate marketing business, you don't have to invest money in the beginning. You can sign up for free with any affiliate network and start promoting their brands right away.\xa0Commission rates are typically based on a percentage of the total sale and in some cases can also be a flat fee for each transaction. The rates are set by the merchant.Who manages your affiliate program?\xa0Some merchants run their affiliate programs internally, while others choose to contract out management to a network or an external agency.\xa0Cookies are small pieces of data that work with web browsers to store information such as user preferences, login or registration data, and shopping cart contents. When someone clicks on your affiliate link, a cookie is placed on the user's computer or mobile device. That cookie is used to remember the link or ad that the visitor clicked on. Even if the user leaves your site and comes back a week later to make a purchase, you will still get credit for the sale and receive a commission it depends on the site cookies duration\xa0The merchant determines the duration of a cookie, also known as its “cookie life.” The most common length for an affiliate program is 30 days. If someone clicks on your affiliate link, you’ll be paid a commission if they purchase within 30 days of the click.", 'image_url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLCGYdIHSYPp0B6qIW9VwN-URfa73Wf2kKkpBANspBG-j_RryJDZcR8ud0YgtKoH_n450v_5Q_o8tX27XrZYmJ3bOTiWxUD4XjBdYcCMlDd_edn6ZnSFfxhx82zU_wtWgGDXB3H3awFvp6Dr0UayT_Hv7MV7-at2K1nY3N2L5nMc-MBSpOLL5e7VrIdw/s72-w640-h360-c/Most-Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Email-Marketing-min.webp'}

A world in which you don’t need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That’s exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.It’s like your computer’s hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain.\xa0Blockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.A few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called “Bit Gold.” However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.A blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.Blockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.Blockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.To understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:Let’s get to know more about the blockchain.Blockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can\'t be changed or destroyed. That\'s why blockchain is also called "Distributed Ledger Technology" or DLT.Here’s how it works:And that’s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it’s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.Even though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.Blockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM\'s Food Trust uses blockchain to track food\'s journey before reaching its final destination.Although some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.Tracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been—so they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks.Blockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.Blockchain technology is safe, even if it’s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.Have you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn\'t it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?Blockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.Instead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called “Decentralization,” meaning all the information is stored in multiple places.Blockchain guarantees your data\'s authenticity—not just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company\'s product inventory.Blockchain has many advantages and disadvantages.\xa0I’ll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section.Blockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It\'s a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly.Yes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult.Coinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy.Blockchain is a decentralized technology. It’s a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device. Thus, one owns blockhain.Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is powered by Blockchain technology while Blockchain is a distributed ledger of cryptocurrency\xa0Generally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties.Blockchain has a wide spectrum of applications and, over the next 5-10 years, we will likely see it being integrated into all sorts of industries. From finance to healthcare, blockchain could revolutionize the way we store and share data. Although there is some hesitation to adopt blockchain systems right now, that won\'t be the case in 2022-2023 (and even less so in 2026). Once people become more comfortable with the technology and understand how it can work for them, owners, CEOs and entrepreneurs alike will be quick to leverage blockchain technology for their own gain.

People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs.NFT stands for non-fungible\xa0 token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc.A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information—such as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts—in one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can’t be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.The value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn’t necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.One of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain.\xa0As with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can’t be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network.\xa0NFTs also contain smart contracts—small computer programs that run on the blockchain—that give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?Anyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you’ll be able to upload and sell your creationsWhen you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain—the bitcoin ledger of transactions—and that entry acts as your proof of ownership.The value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.In the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.Non-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.Many people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art.There are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.To mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.The answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Solana, Polygon, and so on. Once a Non-Fungible Token is minted, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and the contract or license is awarded to whoever has that Non-Fungible Token in their wallet.You can sell your work and creations by attaching a license to it on the blockchain, where its ownership can be transferred. This lets you get exposure without losing full ownership of your work. Some of the most successful projects include Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yatch Club NFTs, SandBox, World of Women and so on. These NFT projects have gained popularity globally and are owned by celebrities and other successful entrepreneurs. Owning one of these NFTs gives you an automatic ticket to exclusive business meetings and life-changing connections.That’s a wrap. Hope you guys found this article enlightening.

A grand vaporwave-and-neon mansion stands on the Malibu coastline, and you – Jae, the producer – sleep in the bleak little basement underneath it. Your job is to stalk around the house behind a camera, filming the glamorous, sexy participants in a reality show. You choose the cast every season, from a panel of 12, and you trail them around the lurid property, hoping they fight, or make out, or both, so that your ratings will go up and your viewers will be satisfied. You can move about freely, but are warned to absolutely never talk to the cast. The game certainly does, as the tagline suggests, take on the feel of a first-person shooter, but you wield a camera instead of a gun. Think Pokémon Snap, but sexy.Every night, a different set of audiences tune in, and all of them have very specific needs – some want drama, some want to see the art that hangs in the house, some want to see food being prepared.

The 61-year-old is drinking a Red Bull, which is the only perceptible trace that the far-right riots around the UK are, in his words, “taking a toll”. “It’s been tiring and it’s been emotional,” he says. “I’ve had people coming to me from all over the country, particularly people in minority communities, not just Muslim communities, saying: ‘What’s happening? What can we do? I’m scared.’ What can I say to them, in terms of reassurance? All I can say is what I’ve been saying all week: there will be consequences for those involved. We might have more smartphones, but we have fewer smart people. Every crime has been recorded.”Afzal describes his life as a lawyer, and his life before that, as one of stubborn faith that the law could be used as a force for social good. But when people ask the questions he describes – “How do we get through this? What do I say to my family? What do I say to my children?” – the promise that justice will be served is not only a vital reassurance, it reflects how bad things have become. “It’s what I remember from the 60s and 70s,” he says. “It’s what my children don’t remember because they’ve never seen it, but they’re feeling it now.

Mobile internet and smartphones were uncommon luxuries in Nigeria at the time, with only 9% of the 156 million population having internet access. My habit of searching for my name online was confined to when I was working in the office, or at home tethered to an unreliable external modem.

But we’ve neglected our playing fields, sporting facilities and community programmesIn the early 20th century, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) refused to publish medals tables, considering them vulgar and a goad to competitive nationalism rather than the cooperative internationalism that the Games were meant to nurture. It heartily disapproved of the US press which invented them as part of its coverage of the 1908 London Games as a way of selling papers and tracking the US’s sporting ascent and Britain’s decline. The IOC has since made its peace with the medals table, and at each Games it is offered – especially for those at the top – as a measure of national prowess and power.How then to read Team GB’s performance at Paris 2024, seventh in the table with 14 golds and 65 medals in total? By the first two criteria, this marks a decline from the highs of London 2012 (29 golds and third in the table) and Rio 2016 (27 golds and second in the table), though that this should appear disappointing is a measure of the transformation of UK elite sport since the Olympic nadir of Atlanta 1996 where the UK won just one gold medal and finished 36th in the rankings. That said, the total number of medals won is about the same as recent Olympics and, given the small margins of elite competition, the UK could easily have finished higher up the table.', 'image_url': None}

When I’ve had those experiences, I remember thinking: “Please let me hold on to this insight, if or when the grief fades.” But you never do: daily life, and its less profound priorities, take over again at the wheel.This then is some of the value of a new show by the always extraordinary Sh!t Theatre, entitled Or What’s Left of Us: it pulls the veil back again. Becca Biscuit and Louise Mothersole have both experienced grievous loss – of a parent in Mothersole’s case, and of a partner in Biscuit’s: Adam Brace, who was also the duo’s director, before he shockingly died last year. The show finds them uncertain, in light of that, whether they can even be Sh!t Theatre any more. So out go their usual white-painted faces, the video material, the alt.documentary zeal – and in comes total absorption in folk music, as a lens through which to consider death and bereavement, as generation upon generation have had to live with it (because what alternative is there?) before.Sh!t Theatre: Or What’s Left of Us is at Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustBrian Logan is the Guardian’s comedy critic and the artistic director of A Play, a Pie and a Pint', 'image_url': None}

Bridget Phillipson should heed their concernsThe post-16 educational landscape in England and Wales is patchy and messy. It is also unequal and unfair. For the most academic students, the expectation is that they apply to university after studying A-levels for two years. Currently, around a third of young people follow this route, and while by no means perfect, it is at least clear. The same cannot be said for the options faced by the other two-thirds. The reform of the other qualifications on offer to this age group has resulted in a worrying standoff between government officials and those on the ground.The introduction of T-levels, under the Tories, was meant to be a levelling up measure – to put vocational learning on a footing with academic pathways, equipping young people for skilled jobs and making our system more like the German one. Some of the new courses are high-quality, but slow take-up and questions about their suitability for some of the cohort mean that resistance to the phase-out of older qualifications has built up. In opposition, Labour signalled a willingness to pause and review the situation, in advance of the defunding of popular courses including BTecs. In government, however, the tune has changed. A decision about which courses will be saved will be made by ministers and civil servants by Christmas – in a separate process from the wider curriculum review that is also under way.', 'image_url': None}

A sharp little exhale, a vocalisation of effort, maybe even a muttered “yup” as a barbell ascends. I’m not bellowing “Arnold!” on every movement, but I can get a bit noisy.Is this so wrong? It depends who you ask. A recent study of more than 300 UK residents found that male grunting “diminishes perceptions of masculinity and both physical and social attractiveness” – though it does also, apparently, “enhance perceptions of social dominance”, which for some men is probably part of the point. Famously, US gym chain Planet Fitness has its own “lunk alarm”, a siren that can be activated when lifters get too loud, triggering a staff intervention. “Yesterday: me doing barbell stuff, which was hard,” journalist and writer Rose George recently tweeted. “I did it quietly. Next to me, two young men doing free weights, not too heavy. Grunt, huff, puff, grunt, huff. Why?”', 'image_url': None}

As a demanding older sister, I make it known how glad I am that my cookbooks are not only up there, too, but have also clearly been pulled out relatively recently.

And of those that are there, which are used most.Prashad, Kaushy Patel’s 2012 book of vegetarian Indian cooking, is right in the middle of the shelf, its spine showing signs of a hard-working life. As are the spines of Nigella’s How to Eat, Delia’s Complete Cookery Course and a book of British baking, which has also spent some time in a sunny spot and is suitably faded. Bee Wilson’s The Secret of Cooking is the newest arrival on the shelf and already looking a bit knocked about (my sister first picked it up at my house, sat at the table reading for ages before looking up and saying, “I don’t hate this”. Then went off and bought herself a copy). Rukmini Iyer’s bright-green The Quick Roasting Tin is also used weekly. Then there are two books by Anna Del Conte, the very sight of which are reassuring: Cooking with Coco, which she wrote about cooking with her granddaughter, and a 2012 compendium called Italian Kitchen, which has a pan of golden sweet-and-sour onions on the cotton cover. Italian Kitchen is the book I pulled off the shelf to read while I drank my coffee the other morning.

The shirt, made by Adidas, is designed by Foday Dumbuya, founder of the London menswear brand Labrum, and it pays specific homage to the club’s African fanbase, and to the players – Nwankwo Kanu, Kolo Touré and others – whose deeds are woven into the north London club’s recent history. Using black, red and green details to refer to the pan-African flag, Dumbuya – who was born in Sierra Leone and moved to London at the age of 12 – intended the design to celebrate what he sees as Arsenal’s unique place in the multicultural capital and its appeal to fans, including Spike Lee and Jay-Z, worldwide. Dumbuya’s design is a natural successor to the club’s green, black and gold “Jamaica” pre-match kit, launched at the Notting Hill carnival in 2022.That heritage and spirit is also the focus of a new book, Black Arsenal, published for the start of the season, created and co-edited by Clive Chijioke Nwonka, associate professor of film, culture and society at University College London (UCL). With contributors that range from cultural studies stars to pioneering former players Ian Wright and Paul Davis, the book examines how the club has become an authentic expression of integrated Black British culture.

Its visitors have included Oscar Wilde and Hemingway, Goethe and Tennessee Williams. It was not for nothing that DH Lawrence set his story Sun in Taormina; its whole drama is a kind of homage to the restorative powers of heat and light. In the first line a young woman under English skies is prescribed a vitamin D cure: “‘Take her away, into the sun,’ the doctors said”; a few paragraphs later, in Taormina, the unnamed patient is transported to the ultimate seaside reverie: “She could feel the sun penetrating even into her bones; nay, further, even into her emotions and her thoughts. The dark tensions of her emotion began to give way, the cold dark clots of her thoughts began to dissolve. She was beginning to feel warm right through. Turning over, she let her shoulders dissolve in the sun… And she lay half stunned with wonder at the thing that was happening to her.”', 'image_url': None}

They’re about to incorporate user-generated advertisements in their system. This new development comes as quite a surprise, given the company’s previous statements against the use of ads for revenue generation. However, it appears that the winds have shifted, and now, Discord is ready to explore the financial potential of\xa0ads.Historically, Discord has always been vocal about its anti-advertising stance. The company’s business model relied heavily on its “Nitro” subscriptions, which offered users enhanced functionality for a monthly fee ranging from $2.99 to $9.99. The decision to open up to advertisements marks a significant shift in their revenue generation approach.According to a report from The Wall Street Journal, Discord is planning to feature ads from video game developers and publishers in the coming week. The concept is that users will earn rewards for playing games and accomplishing “Sponsored Quests,” which are specific in-game tasks, while they stream for their friends to watch. The friends viewing the stream will then get their chances to complete a sponsored quest and earn their\xa0rewards.This approach bears a striking resemblance to the digital rewards or drops offered by Twitch, another popular streaming service, to viewers who watch certain streams as a part of paid partnerships.In January, Discord laid off 17% of its workforce, amounting to around 170 employees. This drastic decision, as stated by CEO Jason Citron, was a result of the need to “sharpen our focus” and “bring more agility to our organization.” This organizational shakeup seems to have paved the way for the introduction of ads on\xa0Discord.The integration of ads into Discord’s platform raises several questions. Will this move work in the company’s favor? How will users respond to the inclusion of ads in the otherwise seamless communication platform?Many users prefer Discord for its simple and unobtrusive communication capabilities. The introduction of ads could potentially dilute this experience, regardless of the digital goodies offered alongside them.Moreover, Discord’s plan to monetize user interactions might not sit well with some users. The idea of having their friendships monetized by the platform might lead to user dissatisfaction.It remains to be seen how this new development will pan out for Discord. It’s a risky move that could either bear fruit or backfire, depending on how the users\xa0react.It’s indeed a wait-and-watch situation for all stakeholders involved.In conclusion, the decision by Discord to incorporate user-generated ads represents a significant shift in their business model. While the idea of earning rewards for completing “Sponsored Quests” might sound appealing to some, others might see it as an intrusion into their gaming experience. Only time will tell whether this bold move will pay off for Discord, or if it will lead to user dissatisfaction and subsequently, a decline in their user\xa0base.', 'image_url': 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*faAaE7r0EARbL4v_'}

This upcoming open-world crime simulator has millions of gamers on the edge of their seats, eagerly waiting for any shred of news, screenshots, or updates. However, recent reports suggest that the game’s development has encountered some speed bumps, raising concerns about the originally slated release date for\xa02025.GTA 6 was officially announced in December 2023, almost a decade after the release of its predecessor, GTA V, which has garnered massive sales numbers and continues to grow in popularity. The announcement of the sequel set the gaming world ablaze with excitement and anticipation. Set in Vice City, a fictional take on Miami, Florida, GTA 6 is expected to be launched for PS5 and Xbox Series sometime in 2025, or at least that was the original\xa0plan.However, as per reports from anonymous sources, the development of GTA 6 has started experiencing delays, causing alarm among the leadership at Rockstar Games. The initial release window of 2025 might not be met, and the game could potentially slip into 2026. This unnerving possibility has led to Rockstar Games making a drastic decision of mandating its employees to return to work in-office from April\xa02024.This return-to-office mandate, as reported by Bloomberg in February, was a sudden and radical change that caught many employees off guard. It has led to a wave of dissatisfaction among staff members who were hired remotely and now feel pushed out. The decision was primarily driven by concerns about security and quality, but it seems that the predicament of GTA 6’s development falling behind schedule also played a significant part in this decision.Despite these measures, uncertainties persist around the game’s release timeline. While the internal target is still set for spring 2025, insiders suggest that a more realistic timeline would see the game launching in fall 2025. The reluctance of Rockstar to provide a specific release window beyond “2025” further underscores the uncertainty surrounding GTA 6’s development.Recent speculations align with a fan theory suggesting that GTA 6’s development may wrap up by early 2025. This theory is based on job listings indicating the completion of localization work in Q1 of that year. However, considering the history of the franchise, which is notorious for delays, the possibility of GTA 6 slipping into 2026 remains plausible.Should such a delay occur, it could also impact the release of the PC port, potentially pushing its availability to 2027 or later. This scenario mirrors the experience with GTA 5, which faced significant delays for its PC version, ultimately lagging behind its console counterparts.As fans eagerly await further updates, the uncertainty surrounding GTA 6’s development serves as a reminder of the challenges inherent in bringing such ambitious projects to fruition within set timelines. Nevertheless, the gaming community continues to be captivated by the mystery surrounding GTA 6’s development and\xa0release.The release of GTA 6 is undoubtedly one of the most highly anticipated events in the gaming world. While the potential delay might be disappointing for eager fans, it’s important to remember that creating a game of this magnitude is no small feat. As we wait for further updates from Rockstar Games, the gaming community can only hope that the final product will be worth the\xa0wait.Disclaimer: This article is a work of speculation based on available reports and fan theories. The actual timeline for the release of GTA 6 may differ from what is presented in this\xa0article.', 'image_url': 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*_BVux8StgfIceqZo'}

Recent developments hint towards a potential partnership that will leverage Google’s generative artificial intelligence model, Gemini, to enhance the next-generation iPhone.Apple and Google’s collaboration is not a new phenomenon. Over the years, these tech giants have worked together to provide services like maps and search functionality on Apple’s\xa0devices.According to reliable sources, Apple and Google are in early discussions about integrating Google’s generative AI model, Gemini, into Apple’s next iPhone.

The Game Launcher, an app familiar to all Samsung phone users, has now been rebranded as the Gaming Hub. This move aims to unify Samsung’s gaming services across its different platforms.Samsung’s Game Launcher was an integral part of Samsung smartphones, providing a platform for users to access and manage their games. However, the recent rebranding has transformed the Game Launcher into the Gaming Hub. This change is more than just a new name; it integrates the Game Launcher’s features with Samsung’s other gaming services, especially those available on smart displays like smart TVs and projectors.Despite the rebranding, Samsung assures its users that the functionality and features of the Game Launcher will remain consistent in the Gaming Hub. The name change, however, aims to eliminate the confusion that arose from having two separate apps\u200a—\u200athe Game Launcher on smartphones and the Gaming Hub on smart displays\u200a—\u200awhen they essentially offered the same services.Samsung first launched the Gaming Hub in 2022, and it quickly gained popularity for its user-friendly interface and extensive features. One of the most notable features was the ability to connect a wireless controller to the display and utilize popular game streaming services. Samsung went a step further and introduced its own streaming service\u200a—\u200aInstant\xa0Plays.Instant Plays, a feature available on both the mobile Gaming Hub and on smart displays, allows users to start playing a game immediately without any need for downloading or installing it. Even though Instant Plays has been around since 2022, it remains in beta mode and is currently available only in the US and Canada. However, its promise of instant gaming has been a significant draw for users and contributes to the success of the Gaming\xa0Hub.Samsung’s rebranding efforts are not just about offering a seamless gaming experience to users. The company is also focused on providing support to game developers. Samsung’s cloud platform supports Android native APKs, provides a cloud-based attribution solution with major mobile measurement partner (MMP) providers, and even supports existing in-game monetization models. This initiative ensures that game publishers can easily integrate their operations with Samsung’s Gaming\xa0Hub.Some Samsung users noticed the rebranding of the Game Launcher to the Gaming Hub quite some time ago, while others are just now seeing the change. The response has been mixed, with some users expressing concern about the name change, but most seem to appreciate the unified approach to Samsung’s gaming services.The rebranding announcement also highlighted the Gaming Hub’s ability to stream games on mobile devices. The Instant Plays feature, which enables users to stream games without downloading them, is one of the primary reasons for the app’s growing popularity.While the rebranding of the Game Launcher to the Gaming Hub is an important step, many users and experts are looking forward to what Samsung will do next. One of the most anticipated features is the integration of cloud gaming services like Nvidia GeForce Now and Xbox Cloud Gaming into the mobile Gaming Hub. Currently, these services are only available on the Gaming Hub on Samsung TVs. If Samsung can bring these services to its mobile Gaming Hub, it would provide an all-in-one platform for accessing all cloud gaming services and their offerings, right from a Galaxy smartphone or\xa0tablet.In conclusion, Samsung’s move to rebrand the Game Launcher as the Gaming Hub is a strategic one that aims to eliminate confusion and provide a unified gaming experience across all its devices. By integrating features like Instant Plays and potentially adding other cloud gaming services, the Gaming Hub is set to become a one-stop solution for gaming enthusiasts using Samsung\xa0devices.', 'image_url': 'https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*JtUsVfMz4L64Vkdx'}

This move would facilitate landscape-mode FaceTime calls and other video conferencing applications, marking a significant change from the traditional portrait-mode design.The proposed change doesn’t come without its challenges. The central placement of the camera could interfere with the magnetic attachment for the Apple Pencil. Apple’s solution for this issue is eagerly awaited by tech enthusiasts worldwide.The relocated camera is speculated to carry the name “Landscape Ultra Wide camera” and is expected to retain the Center Stage support that iPad Air 5 offers.

This would cater to different user preferences, with the larger model offering a more immersive viewing experience.Earlier this year, CAD designs of what could be the 12.9-inch iPad Air were revealed.

You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!\xa0An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.\xa0Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.\xa0 Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.\xa0Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.\n\xa0Performance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising. Affiliate marketing is one form of performance marketing where commissions are paid out to affiliates on a performance basis when they click on their affiliate link and make a purchase or action.\xa0Smartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity.\xa0The best way to find affiliate publishers is on reputable networks like ShareASale Cj(Commission Junction), Awin, and Impact radius. These networks have a strict application process and compliance checks, which means that all affiliates are trustworthy.\xa0An affiliate disclosure statement discloses to the reader that there may be affiliate links on a website, for which a commission may be paid to the publisher if visitors follow these links and make purchases.\xa0Publishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic.\xa0A super affiliate is an affiliate partner who consistently drives a large majority of sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in that program.\xa0 Affiliates make a lot of money from affiliate marketing Pat Flynn earned more than $50000 in 2013 from affiliate marketing.\xa0Publishers can be identified by their publisher ID, which is used in tracking cookies to determine which publishers generate sales. The activity is then viewed within a network's dashboard.\xa0Because the Internet is so widespread, affiliate programs can be promoted in any country. Affiliate strategies that are set internationally need to be tailored to the language of the targeted country.Affiliate marketing can help you grow your business in the following ways:\xa0One of the best ways to work with qualified affiliates is to hire an affiliate marketing agency that works with all the networks. Affiliates are carefully selected and go through a rigorous application process to be included in the network.\xa0Affiliate marketing is generally associated with websites, but there are other ways to promote your affiliate links, including:\xa0To build your affiliate marketing business, you don't have to invest money in the beginning. You can sign up for free with any affiliate network and start promoting their brands right away.\xa0Commission rates are typically based on a percentage of the total sale and in some cases can also be a flat fee for each transaction. The rates are set by the merchant.Who manages your affiliate program?\xa0Some merchants run their affiliate programs internally, while others choose to contract out management to a network or an external agency.\xa0Cookies are small pieces of data that work with web browsers to store information such as user preferences, login or registration data, and shopping cart contents. When someone clicks on your affiliate link, a cookie is placed on the user's computer or mobile device. That cookie is used to remember the link or ad that the visitor clicked on. Even if the user leaves your site and comes back a week later to make a purchase, you will still get credit for the sale and receive a commission it depends on the site cookies duration\xa0The merchant determines the duration of a cookie, also known as its “cookie life.” The most common length for an affiliate program is 30 days. If someone clicks on your affiliate link, you’ll be paid a commission if they purchase within 30 days of the click.", 'image_url': 'https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjLCGYdIHSYPp0B6qIW9VwN-URfa73Wf2kKkpBANspBG-j_RryJDZcR8ud0YgtKoH_n450v_5Q_o8tX27XrZYmJ3bOTiWxUD4XjBdYcCMlDd_edn6ZnSFfxhx82zU_wtWgGDXB3H3awFvp6Dr0UayT_Hv7MV7-at2K1nY3N2L5nMc-MBSpOLL5e7VrIdw/s72-w640-h360-c/Most-Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Email-Marketing-min.webp'}

A world in which you don’t need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That’s exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.It’s like your computer’s hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain.\xa0Blockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.A few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called “Bit Gold.” However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.A blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.Blockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.Blockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.To understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:Let’s get to know more about the blockchain.Blockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can\'t be changed or destroyed. That\'s why blockchain is also called "Distributed Ledger Technology" or DLT.Here’s how it works:And that’s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it’s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.Even though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.Blockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM\'s Food Trust uses blockchain to track food\'s journey before reaching its final destination.Although some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.Tracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been—so they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks.Blockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.Blockchain technology is safe, even if it’s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.Have you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn\'t it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?Blockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.Instead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called “Decentralization,” meaning all the information is stored in multiple places.Blockchain guarantees your data\'s authenticity—not just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company\'s product inventory.Blockchain has many advantages and disadvantages.\xa0I’ll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section.Blockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It\'s a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly.Yes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult.Coinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy.Blockchain is a decentralized technology. It’s a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device. Thus, one owns blockhain.Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is powered by Blockchain technology while Blockchain is a distributed ledger of cryptocurrency\xa0Generally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties.Blockchain has a wide spectrum of applications and, over the next 5-10 years, we will likely see it being integrated into all sorts of industries. From finance to healthcare, blockchain could revolutionize the way we store and share data. Although there is some hesitation to adopt blockchain systems right now, that won\'t be the case in 2022-2023 (and even less so in 2026). Once people become more comfortable with the technology and understand how it can work for them, owners, CEOs and entrepreneurs alike will be quick to leverage blockchain technology for their own gain.

People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs.NFT stands for non-fungible\xa0 token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc.A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information—such as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts—in one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can’t be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.The value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn’t necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.One of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain.\xa0As with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can’t be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network.\xa0NFTs also contain smart contracts—small computer programs that run on the blockchain—that give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?Anyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you’ll be able to upload and sell your creationsWhen you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain—the bitcoin ledger of transactions—and that entry acts as your proof of ownership.The value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.In the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.Non-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.Many people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art.There are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.To mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.The answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Solana, Polygon, and so on. Once a Non-Fungible Token is minted, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and the contract or license is awarded to whoever has that Non-Fungible Token in their wallet.You can sell your work and creations by attaching a license to it on the blockchain, where its ownership can be transferred. This lets you get exposure without losing full ownership of your work. Some of the most successful projects include Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yatch Club NFTs, SandBox, World of Women and so on. These NFT projects have gained popularity globally and are owned by celebrities and other successful entrepreneurs. Owning one of these NFTs gives you an automatic ticket to exclusive business meetings and life-changing connections.That’s a wrap. Hope you guys found this article enlightening.

The period between September and November is usually stacked with AAA releases as publishers jostle for space in the historically lucrative run-up to Christmas. Even in this era of “live service” games such as Fortnite, Destiny and Genshin Impact (which ignore external sales patterns in favour of their own ever-updating season passes) you’re usually guaranteed an autumnal belch of major gaming releases.But this year … not so much. September is mostly about The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (below). October is the Silent Hill 2 reboot, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and at a stretch Sonic X Shadow Generations. We have to wait until November for a truly busy blockbuster lineup with Slitterhead, Football Manager 2025, Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Stalker 2: Heart of Chernobyl all lining up for our wintery delectation.

The 61-year-old is drinking a Red Bull, which is the only perceptible trace that the far-right riots around the UK are, in his words, “taking a toll”. “It’s been tiring and it’s been emotional,” he says. “I’ve had people coming to me from all over the country, particularly people in minority communities, not just Muslim communities, saying: ‘What’s happening? What can we do? I’m scared.’ What can I say to them, in terms of reassurance? All I can say is what I’ve been saying all week: there will be consequences for those involved. We might have more smartphones, but we have fewer smart people. Every crime has been recorded.”Afzal describes his life as a lawyer, and his life before that, as one of stubborn faith that the law could be used as a force for social good. But when people ask the questions he describes – “How do we get through this? What do I say to my family? What do I say to my children?” – the promise that justice will be served is not only a vital reassurance, it reflects how bad things have become. “It’s what I remember from the 60s and 70s,” he says. “It’s what my children don’t remember because they’ve never seen it, but they’re feeling it now.

But we’ve neglected our playing fields, sporting facilities and community programmesIn the early 20th century, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) refused to publish medals tables, considering them vulgar and a goad to competitive nationalism rather than the cooperative internationalism that the Games were meant to nurture. It heartily disapproved of the US press which invented them as part of its coverage of the 1908 London Games as a way of selling papers and tracking the US’s sporting ascent and Britain’s decline. The IOC has since made its peace with the medals table, and at each Games it is offered – especially for those at the top – as a measure of national prowess and power.How then to read Team GB’s performance at Paris 2024, seventh in the table with 14 golds and 65 medals in total? By the first two criteria, this marks a decline from the highs of London 2012 (29 golds and third in the table) and Rio 2016 (27 golds and second in the table), though that this should appear disappointing is a measure of the transformation of UK elite sport since the Olympic nadir of Atlanta 1996 where the UK won just one gold medal and finished 36th in the rankings. That said, the total number of medals won is about the same as recent Olympics and, given the small margins of elite competition, the UK could easily have finished higher up the table.', 'image_url': None}

Bridget Phillipson should heed their concernsThe post-16 educational landscape in England and Wales is patchy and messy. It is also unequal and unfair. For the most academic students, the expectation is that they apply to university after studying A-levels for two years. Currently, around a third of young people follow this route, and while by no means perfect, it is at least clear. The same cannot be said for the options faced by the other two-thirds. The reform of the other qualifications on offer to this age group has resulted in a worrying standoff between government officials and those on the ground.The introduction of T-levels, under the Tories, was meant to be a levelling up measure – to put vocational learning on a footing with academic pathways, equipping young people for skilled jobs and making our system more like the German one. Some of the new courses are high-quality, but slow take-up and questions about their suitability for some of the cohort mean that resistance to the phase-out of older qualifications has built up. In opposition, Labour signalled a willingness to pause and review the situation, in advance of the defunding of popular courses including BTecs. In government, however, the tune has changed. A decision about which courses will be saved will be made by ministers and civil servants by Christmas – in a separate process from the wider curriculum review that is also under way.', 'image_url': None}

The average weight for a hardback cookbook is apparently 0.91kg and, while there are a few paperbacks and outliers up there, most of these 34 books look of pretty average build. It’s hardly surprising, then, that the slim shelf is more than gently sagging. As a demanding older sister, I make it known how glad I am that my cookbooks are not only up there, too, but have also clearly been pulled out relatively recently. As a food writer who has given my sister books over the years, I am interested to see which ones are there; which books belonging to a working mum of three, who describes herself as “an utterly average, functional cook who is easily annoyed by cookbooks but needs them, and likes to eat good things”, have made it on to the shelf. And of those that are there, which are used most.Prashad, Kaushy Patel’s 2012 book of vegetarian Indian cooking, is right in the middle of the shelf, its spine showing signs of a hard-working life. As are the spines of Nigella’s How to Eat, Delia’s Complete Cookery Course and a book of British baking, which has also spent some time in a sunny spot and is suitably faded. Bee Wilson’s The Secret of Cooking is the newest arrival on the shelf and already looking a bit knocked about (my sister first picked it up at my house, sat at the table reading for ages before looking up and saying, “I don’t hate this”. Then went off and bought herself a copy). Rukmini Iyer’s bright-green The Quick Roasting Tin is also used weekly. Then there are two books by Anna Del Conte, the very sight of which are reassuring: Cooking with Coco, which she wrote about cooking with her granddaughter, and a 2012 compendium called Italian Kitchen, which has a pan of golden sweet-and-sour onions on the cotton cover. Italian Kitchen is the book I pulled off the shelf to read while I drank my coffee the other morning. And this week’s recipe is a variation of Anna’s straightforward and good torta di noci, or walnut cake, with added hazelnuts.', 'image_url': None}

The shirt, made by Adidas, is designed by Foday Dumbuya, founder of the London menswear brand Labrum, and it pays specific homage to the club’s African fanbase, and to the players – Nwankwo Kanu, Kolo Touré and others – whose deeds are woven into the north London club’s recent history. Using black, red and green details to refer to the pan-African flag, Dumbuya – who was born in Sierra Leone and moved to London at the age of 12 – intended the design to celebrate what he sees as Arsenal’s unique place in the multicultural capital and its appeal to fans, including Spike Lee and Jay-Z, worldwide. Dumbuya’s design is a natural successor to the club’s green, black and gold “Jamaica” pre-match kit, launched at the Notting Hill carnival in 2022.That heritage and spirit is also the focus of a new book, Black Arsenal, published for the start of the season, created and co-edited by Clive Chijioke Nwonka, associate professor of film, culture and society at University College London (UCL). With contributors that range from cultural studies stars to pioneering former players Ian Wright and Paul Davis, the book examines how the club has become an authentic expression of integrated Black British culture. In a week in which the ugly face of racial conflict has been a dispiriting reality, it’s a reminder of the great strides this country has made in moving beyond such tensions, with the national game and the global brand of the Premier League at the front edge of that advance.', 'image_url': None}

Its visitors have included Oscar Wilde and Hemingway, Goethe and Tennessee Williams. It was not for nothing that DH Lawrence set his story Sun in Taormina; its whole drama is a kind of homage to the restorative powers of heat and light. In the first line a young woman under English skies is prescribed a vitamin D cure: “‘Take her away, into the sun,’ the doctors said”; a few paragraphs later, in Taormina, the unnamed patient is transported to the ultimate seaside reverie: “She could feel the sun penetrating even into her bones; nay, further, even into her emotions and her thoughts. The dark tensions of her emotion began to give way, the cold dark clots of her thoughts began to dissolve. She was beginning to feel warm right through. Turning over, she let her shoulders dissolve in the sun… And she lay half stunned with wonder at the thing that was happening to her.”', 'image_url': None}
